For a few month I started to volunteer for the Shortcut organisation as a coding teacher. About the organisation you can find more information [here](http://theshortcut.org/).

Since then my teacher journey has begone. I am helping refugees to learn some HTML & CSS & JavaScript every Thursday for a couple of hours. And there is more people coming — what feels great — so I decided to share the lessons I learnt from teaching.

##### Lesson 1: People are actually grateful.

I have to confess that, but people in volunteering organisations (from my personal experience) often are disappointing. They do not appreciate volunteers, they have a very high opinion of themselves, some of them are simply rude. People in the Shortcut (and this is just how it is, no advertisement or anything ) were very helpful and supportive. And as a volunteer, you basically do it free of charge in my free time. So the way they treat me matters a lot to me. Those whom I was teaching with were really grateful and appreciated my work, and I could feel that. Thank you for making me believe in gratefulness again.

##### Lesson 2: Those who need / want to learn will eventually learn.

It might seem obvious, but that is the truth that people often forget about. If people do not need it, they will forget it. If they do, they will exercise at home, ask me a million of questions & learn themselves. If they don´t, they will never learn, no matter how much you spend time with them (Tip: do not spend time with those people)

##### Lesson 3: Do not hesitate to tell the truth.

The students I had were coming from different countries (mostly refugees coming from Iraq, Afganistan, Syria etc.). They had totally different technical backgrounds back in their countries. As People come from different backgrounds and some of them lack of basic knowledge of technology, you have to take that into account when teaching. You also have to be able to tell that to your student and point where he should improve.

I was on fire …

##### Lesson 4: Learning is a commitment.

Back to the point 2, if you study, you have to commit to it, practice (basically, the only way to do programming), ask questions, be curious on your own. Come regularly.

##### Lesson 5: Teaching is a commitment too.

Do not just come to the class and sit there waiting for questions. Inspire people.

##### Lesson 6: It makes you feel good about yourself.

_Even if one person out of 20 in your class will eventually do anything close to web development, you will feel proud that you could have helped a person and have an impact on his/her life._

I remember here I was actually super happy one of the students did something cool …

##### Lesson 7: You can tell your story that will inspire people.

The way you treat people tells a lot about you as a person. Becoming a teacher is incredible. _It allows you to guide people, tell them the story about yourself._

##### Lesson 8: It inspires you to learn yourself.

It inspires you to learn a lot yourself in order to teach students later. Often students ask certain questions that even for you are hard to understand. Those teaching sessions have inspired me to learn about network theory more, for example.

##### Lesson 9: It helps to link your knowledge to your experience.

When you are teaching, you are trying to present the information in a sort of “processed” way, meaning that you give the simplest explanations for very complex processes, or the other way round — try to explain stuff in details when possible. You are always referring to your experience, knowledge, sometimes when students ask you certain questions you might find out you have some gaps in understanding. This is fine.

##### Lesson 10: Your students will remind you of yourself.

Back when you started. And you will see how far you have gone. And, hopefully, that will make you feel proud.

That moment I remembered how I started in the first place.

##### Hope you will find it useful! Tell me you you have any teaching experience, how was it for you?
